            "##COMPLETED/FULL-LENGTH## Two interconnected murders, 64 years apart. Plot Set partly in rural England, partly on the sun-kissed coast of southerm Italy, The Painted Altar is a murder mystery mixed with romantic and historical elements (World War Two). Given away at two days old, Mary Rice has spent her life in the shadows. When discovering the suspicious circumstances surrounding her biological mother's death, she embarks on a journey which will shine a light not only on the truth but also on her own identity. Brief extract (in which Mary describes her first meeting with her biological mother) Suddenly, the door had inched open, half a wrinkled face visible behind the tautened chain. \"Hello. Who is it?\" The words I was going to say had of course been well-rehearsed, repeated over and over in my mind like a mantra, but now that the moment had arrived I found myself struggling to remember them. \"Mrs Harvey... I think that you might... well, that you might be...\" The door closed, then slowly opened once more, the chain this time unlatched. And there she was before me - half a metre away, within arm's reach. Thin lips gradually crooking upwards at each corner like the slow beatific kindling of a summer's dawn. \"Oh yes love, I know who you are.\" Posting schedule: I hope to maintain twice-weekly posts (Tuesdays and Fridays) until the end (March/April 2019) Length: 70,000 words (250-300 standard novel pages) About the author: I am a 46-year-old English teacher originally from Lincolnshire. For the last fourteen years I've been living in Italy and hope therefore that the Italian aspects of the novel will have a certain gloss of authenticity. The Painted Altar is my third Wattpad novel. The previous two have both received very positive reader feedback and have recorded 5-figure read counts. The most recent, 'The Wattpad Murders', was selected for the site's featured list.",

            "<pre><p data-p-id=\"8539f392dc25d1fea54ead15df386175\">The Painted Altar is many things. One woman's search for identity and justice. A love story, a novel within a novel, a good old-fashioned whodunnit. As with any narrative which dwells partly in those dark years of the Second World War, it's also about man's inhumanity towards his fellow man.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> <span class=\"fa fa-comment-count fa-wp-neutral-2 \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:28px;\"></span> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"8b93f273b9f0557d589c77f0b637dc1d\">An estimated 150,000 Italians were held captive in Great Britain during the latter part of the war, the vast majority assigned to the country's chronically undermanned agricultural sector. Tales of kindness abound. The handmade toys presented to neighbourhood children. The vegetables smuggled from field to the food-rationed local population.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> <span class=\"fa fa-comment-count fa-wp-neutral-2 \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:28px;\"></span> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"1671eb95683801daf16f150349abc9c1\">Though camp 106a is fictional, and thus too the painted altar described, examples of religious art left behind by Italian POWs are numerous. The cover of this novel, for example, features an image of the Henllan camp near Llandysul in Wales. Of even greater note, meanwhile, is the site on Lamb Holm in the Orkney Islands where prisoners joined two Nissen huts together end-to-end and fashioned a concrete chapel facade (see image beneath). Such works were created with scarce resources during the men's limited free time. Both the aforementioned sites are considered of such artistic and historical importance as to have the official status of listed buildings.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> <span class=\"fa fa-comment-count fa-wp-neutral-2 \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:28px;\"></span> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"b26b812f97328249ee16d5fdee9d07be\">I dedicate this novel to all those men who stooped in the fields shoulder to shoulder with British farmers and Land Girls. Who, despite the uncertain situation at home, shared with the local communities their good humour, songs and creativity.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> <span class=\"fa fa-comment-count fa-wp-neutral-2 \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:28px;\"></span> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"364f14e356fd008c39f3e6f0d3646621\">I dedicate it also to my mother, who grew up during those troubled years amidst those self same shadowed fields.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> <span class=\"fa fa-comment-count fa-wp-neutral-2 \" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"font-size:28px;\"></span> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"20e7d2f3c51baab9a6210c216ec0488f\">If you like what you read, you might consider clicking the vote icon (the little star at the bottom left of each chapter).

Not even the nearby village of Northdyke would have cast that residual urban glow which we later generations are accustomed to.

To lick a faint line along the side of the camp water tower, pick out the sharp, twisted tangle of perimeter wire.

At two days old, with Irene Brennan's full consent, I was handed over to Henry and Violet Rice. Later to become a leading name in the field of prosthetics, my adoptive father was at the time chief surgeon at the military convalesence hospital which had been set up at the nearby Huntley Hall estate. His rugby-playing robustness hinted little at long-standing fertility problems - a defect which, through some unimaginably vaulted sense of male pride, he'd wanted to keep a secret at all costs. News of a pregnant Land Girl just a few miles up the road must have seemed like a godsend.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"14f032e646477fa38341965bb52ffc4c\">My adoptive mother, though the dearest and most precious of women, had always displayed a certain malleability to her husband's whims, enough so to earn amongst her acquaintances the nickname Shrinking, as in Shrinking Violet. Enough so also to agree to the somewhat sinister plan he hatched that war-torn spring of 1944. A theatre nurse who'd first become acquainted with him at the Royal Sussex before the war, she was obliged during a stint on the Sicilian frontline to send letters to friends and family back home announcing the happy news of her pregnancy. Returning secretly in patria, she made the journey up to Lincolnshire; then - now with my newborn self in arms - back south, finally arriving as arranged at Brighton Station for an emotional reunion with family, my adoptive father included. The baby had been born prematurely in the Mediterrannean everyone was told; she'd thought it would make a jolly surprise. It didn't seem to matter that with my darker colouring I resembled neither she nor Henry. The latter's plan had worked a treat, the public perception of a noble and uncompromised masculinity assured.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"7c5f4cb6f7fc2c2620c59875970a1b56\">This was, it seemed, all he really cared about; certainly, he never paid <i>me</i><i> </i>much attention. By the age of twelve or thirteen when school reports made it clear I had no talent or leaning for scientific fields, he appeared to give up on me altogether. For him, I was little more than a pet a husband might buy for a childless, unfulfilled wife - something out of necessity to be tolerated, forborne.<span class=\"comment-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"6b8f1020df07e883c88b1c1b3beb13e2\">It was around that same period that I first became aware of the non-biological status of my parents. Vaguely and mistily so, like a dog may have a certain level of perception that it's of a different species to the other members of the family at whose feet it waits patiently for tossed tidbits under the dining table. There was no single specific Big Moment. No 'Mary, could you come and sit down with us' tell-all. Just hints, suggestions. A gradual slow-drip of crossword-style cryptic clues.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"dc76b190a62eb368477555e9153c636a\">My response, perhaps a subconscious one, was to throw myself into my studies. Subsequently, into my career. I was a headmistress by forty, and no matter what my teaching staff may say about me behind my back - and I have little doubt that when I'm not around the noise is quite deafening - it is a rare morning that my Renault Clio isn't first vehicle to arrive in the school car park and an equally rare evening it isn't the last to leave.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"33626914fafce17c5af401a388d5e4e2\">Though my professional dedication should not be placed in doubt, I admit that it is partly through desperation that I have always sought to occupy myself so. Even in my limited down-time, I prefer not to live in my own world but rather that stuffy Victorian dystopia so eloquently described by the words of Hardy and Conan Doyle and the Bronte sisters. There, or else the even more nefarious theatre of Ruth Rendell's contemporary England. I've just always been afraid that, left unbound to freely roam, my mind would explode with a deafening barrage of questions.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"31292abf1c01f8bffe324f30d46714d2\">The precise details of my birth had not in fact been known to me until the death of my adoptive mother three years earlier. Her passing had seemed somehow doubly sad, those final widowed years having by some distance been the happiest of her adult life.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"9584949628f4f78b96366c5ec7a23e3d\">Along with her last will and testament, the solicitor had presented me with a handwritten letter. Contrite of nature - it was easy to imagine that a tear or two had been shed during its composition - I'd read it through twice, three times. Once the important information had been committed to memory, I'd then taken a kitchen match to it.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"0ab0968f59f8890237198924da09b527\" style=\"text-align:center;\">*<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"72381df4661d48a7c748f54d20386a9b\">As soon as I'd dispensed of vital duties that sad Monday afternoon, I rushed home and folded my black three-piece into a cabin case - the same outfit I'd worn to my adoptive mother's funeral. By four o'clock I was heading out of my native Sussex; by five, found myself jammed in amongst the home-returning commuter traffic on the northbound A1.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"71133b678c9fb25bbaf470395eb2589e\">Looking back now, even at that early stage I'd had an inkling - some stomach-gnawing sense of intuition - that things weren't quite as they seemed. Only the previous week Irene had recounted her latest visit to her GP. Like a motorist whose vehicle passes its MOT with flying colours and thus might be expected to provide problem-free service for the forseeable future, she'd sounded genuinely thrilled that Dr Patel had pronounced her as fit as a Stradivarius.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"e0db723e81b3a2ef72b890d1eddaa24e\">It might sound contrived, the facile platitude of someone writing with the benefit of hindsight, but as I headed north that evening the thought was a troubling one. As the only member of her family to have survived the war, few understood the value of life as deeply as Irene. It meant too much for her, provided her still with too much satisfaction, for her to have just given up on it so meekly, without a fight.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"3ba332fd453cfa8b41e40dd6ff8c7829\" style=\"text-align:center;\">~~~~~<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br></pre>"

She'd been taller than I might have imagined, a certain innate elegance to her stride. The right age, yes, and as she'd drawn closer the delineation of her features had seemed somehow familiar - the same high forehead and slanted cheekbones which were reflected there in the bathroom mirror each morning. On some primal, instinctive level, I'd just known: this was the woman who'd brought me into the world. Had married one of the farmer's sons, carved out a life for herself right there in the south Lincolnshire fens.<span class=\"comment-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"be6ab9808b82b5be09926b479aebc1c4\" style=\"text-align:left;\">I'd watched as she'd slowly disappeared round the corner, then headed back south...<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"14d3e6df2d810af5a04ed76f282671aa\" style=\"text-align:left;\">It hadn't been until the following Easter holidays, almost two months later, that I'd finally summoned the courage to make my way back up the A1 and press a tentative finger to the doorbell.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"06e3d85cc3de17cfbfcc7d88388c4f75\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Undoubtedly it had only been a matter of seconds, but it had seemed much longer. The wait before the door had finally shuddered open. Long enough, I remember, to wonder if it might not be better all around if I made a dash back to the cover of the car, leave Irene confronted by an empty doorstep like the victim of some annoying, puerile prank. Two or three doors down to my right a neighbour had appeared - a woman of around my own age guiding what must have been either a grandson or nephew towards the small playpark on the other side of the street. There had been a mute nod of hello as she'd passed, her curiosity evident in the lingering gaze. At eighty years of age, Irene Harvey's house callers were, I supposed, both few and adherent to established routines.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"d2c938ee8f82ea99e62f52a28302d712\" style=\"text-align:left;\">But then, suddenly, the door had inched open, half a wrinkled face visible behind the tautened chain.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"6fc58e585dc8b80866cec8e146abb031\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\"Hello.

And there she was before me - half a metre away, within arm's reach. Thin lips gradually crooking upwards at each corner like the slow beatific kindling of a summer's dawn.<span class=\"comment-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"f274c1d3a11371ba16cdbd7887b4aead\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\"Oh yes love, I know who you are .\"<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"9405f883d72af86959b36f142f412c78\" style=\"text-align:center;\">*<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"e3e8ad044311c7e65f314b12ce0a27cd\" style=\"text-align:left;\">There are certain people, I know, who wouldn't dream of eating out alone. People who would simply be unable to bear the perceived shame of being so friendless, so socially outcast, that they had no-one to dine with. And yes, during my twenties it was a situation which would sting even that most solitary and self-reliant of hearts which resides there in my chest. It's an ignominy which over the course of the decades I've managed to overcome however, as much through base necessity as anything else. When you're both unmarried and in your working environment find yourself in an aloof position of power, there's very rarely going to be anyone on the other side of the table with whom to dicuss menu options.<span class=\"comment-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"d87ca550692856584820724261bc08e8\" style=\"text-align:left;\">As I trudged away from the church on that sad, drizzle-spitting eve of my mother's funeral, it wasn't so much hunger which compelled me to look for somewhere to eat, more a sense of obbligation. The next twenty-four hours, I sensed, would be draining - emotionally as well as physically. I needed to keep my strength up. <span class=\"comment-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"49b9a3fbd87ed0079a77c6ccdff56a41\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Though Ravensby boasted the usual small town smattering of Indian, Chinese and Italian restaurants, it was still too early for any of them to be open.

Cheap and cheerful, but would have to suffice.<span class=\"comment-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"b1bceb62936c5ee34c1c55d44800a8d1\" style=\"text-align:left;\">I ordered penne and tomato sauce, a glass of Merlot to wash it down with.

A polite and accommodating type, we agreed to meet late-morning. Rather than any sense of my being a nuisance, he actually seemed somewhat relieved. \"There had been dark mutterings from Mrs Simmonds about a trip to Ikea,\" he explained. \"Some new shelving for the pantry. Looks like you've saved my hide Miss Rice.\"<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"efe1a89aed75ac4d9ff61d26d8b5907f\">The second call was to the newsroom of the Ravensby Evening Echo. In contrast to Simmonds, the responding voice this time was a little gruff, unwelcoming, as if the squeal of the phone had broken his concentration.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"ba7321961da97c6e4f358ddce8c54cde\">\"I was hoping to speak to your crime correspondent,\" I began.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"68f646143d15774cace84d9ecd5ea189\">\"Crime correspondent!

A couple of times I asked him to clarify or repeat things, as if scribbling down notes.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"802debf6c1ad12ec00053bd822b117df\">\"What time was it?\" I asked finally.&nbsp; \"When the surveyor spotted the bones.\"<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"a39447c99c669d8f1e8f93504934d59f\">\"Some time early afternoon, after the chap's lunchbreak.

Wasn't that a little self-aggrandising, I reflected,&nbsp; considering he'd said there were only two of them? Clearly, he was the sort of man who enjoyed whatever faint glow of limelight he was able to shove his way into.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"49dc561ddcca00555605e6852bdf0a52\">\"See if I can name-check you in the article somewhere,\" I promised.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"17ba633a8f6c1c59050351a38c7db83b\">This seemed to do the trick. \"The carabinieri have found a younger brother,\" he informed me. <span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"d4f542a6cd7179a1d8df7b297dec09bf\">Interesting, decidedly so. \"We got a name?\"<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"2c348aff780b440fe930bc65c2a8ba87\">\"Salvatore.

There was a bookcase in the breakfast room of the B &amp; B;&nbsp; amongst the dog-eared paperbacks former guests had left behind, I'd also found a guidebook to Italy. Located deep in the&nbsp; heel, Adriatic side, the one paragraph entry for Punto San Giacomo had described it as 'a picturesque fishing village worthy of a half-day visit.'<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"57f7fddde20a961b725af01d09ce4817\">\"Will take a couple of days I expect,\" Shreeves continued. \"You know, all the lab business.\" There was an audible squelch - a quick slurp on his tea mug perhaps. \"Don't expect it'll come to much, even if they get a positive I.D. Looks like Inspector Kubič can't be bothered with it for one.\" I recalled the quote from yesterday's article, about how chief investigating officers have to make 'sensible' decisions regarding resources. \"Can't really blame him I suppose. We <i>are</i><i> </i>talking sixty odd years ago, after all. Anyone who was there at the time'll either be dead or in their eighties at least.\" Far from an enticing prospect for investigating authorities, no. \"Still, makes you wonder though, doesn't it? What the hell happened all those years ago.\" <span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"23b6dd0ab43197cf232acc5d7f60feb2\">\"Indeed,\" I concurred. A study in understatement.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"033c33245ce4855e713ab6137c74d201\">\"Shreeves,\" he reminded me as we said our goodbyes. \"George.\"<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"b9d2ea6857d58d9a4c52682194d19acf\">No, I promised, I wouldn't forget.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"0ab0968f59f8890237198924da09b527\" style=\"text-align:center;\">*<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"b0c0801aa1bb916f148e719bd184d38a\">As I stepped back out onto the street, the precipitation had thickened to the point that it could be described as bonafide rain rather than just heavy drizzle. I barely noticed however, cared little as to what effect my umbrella-less state would have on my hair. My mind was racing once more, turbo charged by the caffeine, by the confirmation George Shreeves had just unwittingly provided.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"24c9b0074ee88455a28b36f37d190886\">Though the conversation had been a brief and curtailed one, the voice I'd taken to be Irene's son-in-law on the other end of the line the previous lunchtime had in fact provided some very specific details... <i>Friday afternoon...in front of the TV...next-door neighbour heard Ginger whining for her tea</i>... Irene hadn't been one of those sorts of elderly people to just sit passively in front of the gogglebox all day, only turning it on when there was something specific she wanted to watch. Apart from our shared passion for Colombo and Poirot and Inspector Morse, her regular viewing schedule included a late-afternoon gameshow she was particularly fond of. This, I knew, aired from 4 to 4.30, after which she would struggle herself from armchair and scoop half a tin of Whiskas into Ginger's bowl. For the TV to have been on and the cat not to have been yet fed, her fading from consciousness, the final sluggish beat of her heart, must therefore have occurred at some point during that thirty minute timeframe. Given her advancing years, I doubt that the attending coroner had conducted more than the most cursory of examinations, his or her conclusion inevitable: she'd gone the way we would all wish to go. Death by natural causes. Peacefully, in her sleep.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"48a66c0195c80f776086b26b46262318\">Of all the tens of thousands of days which had passed since my father's lifeless body had been buried in the&nbsp; fenland soil, it was already pushing the realms of credibility that he should finally be discovered on the very same which saw my mother's sad passing. The odds that this latter fact should occur within two hours of former - within as little as an hour of the news being made public - I would estimate at something approaching a million to one.<span class=\"comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal\"> </span> </p><br> <p data-p-id=\"023a67bcb8de2b19dc8bd7c2f76d6942\">No, that initial dark suspicion had now become a black certainty.
